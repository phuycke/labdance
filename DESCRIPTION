Description: The Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA; Brown & Heathcote, 2008) is a choice-reaction
    time model. It aims to describe human decision-making using variations in certain model
    parameters that are estimated using empirically collected reaction times (RTs) and choice
    data. However, experimenters often collected other types of data (e.g. EEG data, eye tracking
    data...) that might also explain how a decision is made. Additionally, learning takes place
    when humans make decisions, but this is not accounted for by the standard LBA model. This
    package provides three extensions to the original LBA: the Dynamic LBA (dLBA), the neural
    (nLBA) and its combination the Dynamic Neural LBA (dnLBA). The dLBA learns over time, and 
    this is captured in a specific parameter. An added advantage is that this parameter replaces
    the need for individual drift rate parameters. The nLBA uses collected neural data when finding
    the most likely parameter set given the available data. To do this, the nLBA assumes that a 
    relation exists between the neural data and the LBA parameters (specifically the drift rates).
