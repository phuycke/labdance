\usage{
param_draw(base_par, n_drift = NULL, dynamic = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_par}{The parameters that a user wants to generate. Choice between a (starting point of evidence
accumulation k is drawn from U[0, A]), b (bound), t0 (non decision time), sd (standard deviation)
of the drift rate v (v_i ~ N(M, sd)) and beta (learning rate)}

\item{n_drift}{The number of drift rates (i.e. one for each accumulator)}

\item{dynamic}{Whether the model is dynamic or not}
}
\value{
A vector named values
}
\description{
Generates (d)(n)LBA parameters within a reasonable range.
}
\examples{
param_draw(base_par = c("a", "b", "t0", "sd"),
           n_drift  = 8,
           dynamic  = F)
