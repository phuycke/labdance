\usage{
negloglik.behavioral(to_optim, rt, response, conditions = NULL, wr = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{to_optim}{The likelihood for parameter set to_optim is calculated.}

\item{rt}{Trial-by-trial reaction times used for maximum likelihood
estimation. Combined with choice data when finding the most likely parameter
set.}

\item{response}{Trial-by-trial choice data used for maximum likelihood
estimation. Combined with RT data when finding the most likely parameter
set.}

\item{conditions}{Optional: only needed in non dynamic models.
Indicates the different conditions. For instance, when one
has a fast and a slow condition, this vector could indicate whether a
certain trial is fast (1) or slow (2). Different drift rates are then
estimated for each condition, and which trials are used in the estimation
process is determined by conditions.}

\item{wr}{Optional: only needed in dynamic models.
Represents the weight resets that take place in our dynamic model.
This vector is a vector consisting of N binary values (0, 1), indicating
whether a weight reset at trial N has taken place. Hence, if a weight reset
takes place at trial 8, the first 8 elements of wr consist of 7 0's
followed by a single 1.}
}
\value{
numeric value indicating the likelihood of a parameter set given
    the available behavioral data.
}
\description{
Calculates the -log(likelihood) based on the passed behavioral
    (i.e. reaction times and choice) data
}
