\usage{
recovery(base_par, df, cycles = 500, sigma_gen = NULL, sigma_mod = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_par}{The parameters that need to be optimized. For instance, when
all parameters in the dynamic neural LBA need to be optimized, c("a", "b",
"t0", "sd") would need to be passed to base_par.}

\item{df}{The dataset containing the data used in optimization. Contains either
behavioral data (reaction times, choice), neural data or both.}

\item{cycles}{The amount of 'tries' that the optimization method has. More
precisely, recovery will attempt MLE for a total of cycles tries.}

\item{sigma_gen}{Optional: only needed in neural models.
The variance in the generation of the true neural data.}

\item{sigma_mod}{Optional: only needed in neural models.
The assumed variance of the generation of the neural data, since the
true value (sigma_gen) is typically unknown in real life applications.}
}
\value{
numeric containing named values
}
\description{
Optimization function that attempts to find the parameter set that
   fits the passed data best. Automatically determines whether passed data comes
   from a dynamic or non dynamic model. Minimizes the (summed) likelihood using
   a box constraints approach ("L-BFGS-B" algorithm (Byrd et al., 1995)).

\examples{
true      = param_draw(dynamic = T)
simulated = simulate.data(true_pars = true,
                          sigma_gen = 0.01)

recov = recovery(base_par  = c("a", "b", "t0", "sd", "beta"),
                 df        = simulated,
                 cycles    = 500,
                 sigma_mod = 0.01)
