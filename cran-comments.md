## Submission

This is the first submission of the package ["Linear And Ballistic Dynamic And Neural Criterion Estimation"](https://github.com/phuycke/labdance) (LABDANCE). I tested the package thoroughly and believe that it works satisfactorily.
      
## Test environments

* R Under development (unstable) (2022-07-07 r82559 ucrt)
    - using platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32 (64-bit) (using ```win-devel()```)
* macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra
    - R-release, CRAN's setup (using ```rhub()```)

    - R-release, brew (using ```rhub()```)
* Apple Silicon (M1), macOS 11.6 Big Sur
    - R-release (using ```rhub()```)

We were unable to test on an Unix system since `rhub` does not support this at the moment. Please see this [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/rhub_/status/1542039387369885698) for more information.
